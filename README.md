# Pytest

The pytest framework makes writing tiny tests simple, but it can also handle complex functional testing for apps and libraries.


## Step 1)  Kindly create virtual environment.

## Step 2)  Activate the virtual environment

## Step 3) kindly execute your test:
           pytest 
           
           This will print your execution and generate the report of your test function.
